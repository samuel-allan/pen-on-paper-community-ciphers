# Pen-On-Paper Ciphers

## What is this?
This is a list of Pen-On-Paper ciphers that are part of [my reddit contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/9k4cq8/pen_on_paper_cipher_contest/).

## Status of current ciphers

| Name          | Author        | Supported key sizes | Authentication | Best known attack | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| ExampleCipher | Example       | 8, 10, 20 letters   | NO             | Distinguisher (requires ~1024B of ciphertext) with likelyhood 55% and time `2^66`)

*Please note that the ExampleCipher above is not existent and is just a demonstration, will be removed as soon as some other cipher appears here*
